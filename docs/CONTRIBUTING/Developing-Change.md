# Developing a change

If you're making a tiny bugfix that only changes a few lines, then you don't really have to worry about how you structure your development or organise branches. You can just make your fix, open up a pull request, and everything can be handled from there on the fly.

When making a larger change though, there are more things to take into consideration. Your changes need to be compatible with the project on a larger scale, as well as making sure your development process can merge into the mainline development with other contributors and the project maintainers.

There are a few guidelines to follow to make sure that everyone can work together with as little friction as possible:

Be proactive about communication. You can drop into discord and discuss the work you are planning, or currently doing. You can also open an issue to discuss a change. Staying in communication can head off problems at a much earlier stage - perhaps a design you were planning would conflict with the direction of the project or with a better idea of the whole picture we can suggest something that would be more appropriate. It's much better to have a conversation and avoid spending time doing work that will be rejected or require rewrites at PR stage.
